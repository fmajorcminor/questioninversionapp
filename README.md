# Application for inverting French questions



######Interesting things:
- If word is capitalized vs. non-capitalized, it changes confidence level. I've only seen this with Comment. More to come

######Current Problems:
- negation
- combien de + noun

######Frustrating things:
- Figuring out commas was a nightmare
- Was going to try to figure out capitalization, but that was also a nightmare
