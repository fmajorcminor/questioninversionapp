# Application for inverting French questions



######Interesting things:
- If word is capitalized vs. non-capitalized, it changes confidence level. I've only seen this with Comment. More to come

######Current Problems:
- D\'ou doesn't work - it splits it into two words

######Frustrating things:
- Figuring out commas was a nightmare
- Was going to try to figure out capitalization, but that was also a nightmare
